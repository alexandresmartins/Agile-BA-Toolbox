Agile User Story & Acceptance Criteria Generator

This is a simple web-based tool designed to help Business Analysts and product teams quickly draft well-structured user stories and their corresponding acceptance criteria.

The tool demonstrates my understanding of:

-   **Agile Methodology:** The core principles of user stories ("As a... I want... So that...") and their importance in defining requirements.
-   **Requirements Elicitation:** How to break down high-level business needs into actionable, testable criteria.
-   **Technical Collaboration:** The ability to work with and contribute to front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to create a useful tool.

### How to Use

1.  Fill in the three fields: `Persona`, `Goal`, and `Reason`.
2.  Click "Generate User Story."
3.  A pre-formatted user story and a template for acceptance criteria will be generated below.

This project was built to show that even simple tools can solve complex problems and to highlight a foundational skill set for any IT Business Analyst.
