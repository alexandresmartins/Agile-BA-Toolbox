# Agile-BA-Toolbox

 This project is a simple, static HTML/CSS/JavaScript webpage that serves as a tool for a Business Analyst. The core function is to allow a user to input a high-level business need and, with the click of a button, see a pre-formatted Agile user story with acceptance criteria generated for them.
